# Readme-Generator-Inquirer
A README.MD file generator for web developers.

This program utilizes JavaScript and the node package Inquirer to gather information about a project and create a README file accordingly. It uses the command prompt to ask questions through Inquirer and generates the markdown file using javascript's built in file system module. It is intended for web webdevelops and programmers alike for a simple and fast way to generate a README file for their project.

## Usage
- First clone the repository into a directory in your local machine.
- Then go to said directory and run `npm i` in the command line to install the Inquirer node module.
- Wait for the install to finish then run `node index.js` in the command line to run the program.
- Answer the questions about your project in full sentences.
- After choosing the license, your README file should generate in the same directory with the name `generatedREADME.md`
- Feel free to edit and change your newly generated README!
